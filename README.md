## Notes about the game:
1. There is no MP
2. You need to track down quests manually
3. MP is replaced by Magical Molecules(MM), you can spend those to learn skills
4. Some quests/ parts of the map might be bugged bu bear with me, they will be fixed.
5. To track down quests you need to press X, go to the menu, Datalog and select Quests.
6. This game is heavly plugin dependent and might have some conflicts in weird spots since
I have 2 plugin doing the same thing but ina different way
7. The game weighs heavly on monster drop and loot.
8. The crafting system is your best friend, prices in shops are very high
9. There is a farming system but no farming map(Yet)
10. The map is planned to be very huge, but I am not good at map design so it looks ugly(for now at least)
